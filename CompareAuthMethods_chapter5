Auth methods
 - vault components that perform authentication and manage identities
 - responsible for assigning identity and policies to a user
 - multiple authentication methods can be enabled depending on your use case (auth methods can be differentiated by human vs system methods)
 - once authenticated, vault will issue a client token used to make all subsequent vault requests (r/w). The fundamental goal of all auth methods is to obtain a token and each token has an associated policy and a TTL
 - default authentication method for a new vault deployment is token

 - tokens are the core method for authentication within vault (most operations in vault require an existing token)
 - the token auth method is responsible for creating and storing tokens (token auth method cannot be disabled) 
 - authentication with external identity (ldap, oidc) will generate a token

 - if you do not supply a token for non-authentication requests, there are no redirects for authentication (will get a 403 access denied)
