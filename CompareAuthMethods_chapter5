Auth methods
 - vault components that perform authentication and manage identities
 - responsible for assigning identity and policies to a user
 - multiple authentication methods can be enabled depending on your use case (auth methods can be differentiated by human vs system methods)
 - once authenticated, vault will issue a client token used to make all subsequent vault requests (r/w). The fundamental goal of all auth methods is to obtain a token and each token has an associated policy and a TTL
 - default authentication method for a new vault deployment is token

 - tokens are the core method for authentication within vault (most operations in vault require an existing token)
 - the token auth method is responsible for creating and storing tokens (token auth method cannot be disabled) 
 - authentication with external identity (ldap, oidc) will generate a token

 - if you do not supply a token for non-authentication requests, there are no redirects for authentication (will get a 403 access denied)
 - workflow 1. authenticate with credentials 
   2. validate credentials against provider 
   3. generate vault token with policy and ttl 
   4. return token to user 
   5. access secrets in vault using token

 - most auth methods must be enabled before you can see them
 - one or many auth methods can be used at any given time and generally different auth methods are used for different use cases (human vs app)
 - the token auth method is enabled by default, and you cannot enable another nor disable the tokens auth method
 - new vault deployment will use a token for auth
 - only method of auth for a new vault deployment is a root token

 - auth methods can be enabled/disabled and configured using the ui, api, or the cli (we cannot do everything from ui)
 - you must provide a valid token to enable, disable, or modify auth emthods in vault. The vault must also have the proper privileges.
 
 - each auth method is enabled at a path
 - you can choose a path name when you enable the auth method
 - if you do not provide a name, the auth method will be enabled at its default path (path's name is equal to the type of auth method)
 $ vault auth enable approle

 $ vault auth
  - enable
  - disable
  - list
  - tune
  - help

 - enable an auth method at the default path 
 $ vault auth enable approle
 - enable an auth method using a custom path
 $ vault auth enable -path=vault-course -description=MyApps approle (where "auth" is the type of vault object you want to work with, "enable" is the subcommand and "approle" is the type of auth method, "-path" is for customizing the path name)

 - After the auth method has been enabled, use the auth prefix to configure the auth method
 $ vault write auth/<path_name>/<option>
 Example:
 $ vault write auth/approle/role/vault-course secret_id_ttl=10m token_num_uses=10 token_ttl=20m token_max_ttl=30m secret_id_num_uses=40
